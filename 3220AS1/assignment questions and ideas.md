assignment questions:
json file with different size(currently) of stickman
{
	stickman: {
		size: big
		bla
		bla
	}
}// if later we change size to small it will generate small stickman

scrolling background amount is whatever, but needs to scroll back

read file and create many stickman and they don't have to move: yes it's necessary

save file?! save current state?1 stage 3 I guess

add bg music
add trigger music

file not found
missing stuff?
